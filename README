Consistency of image edge filtering is of prime importance for 3D interpretation of image sequences using feature tracking algorithms. To cater for image regions containing texture and isolated features, a combined corner and edge detector based on the local auto-correlation function is utilised, and it is shown to perform with good consistency on natural imagery.
